# Harbormaster

These mods add a new harbour building named "Harbormaster". The harbormaster is a functional copy of the harbourmaster's office. AI controlled players can not build harbormasters. Further modification can be enabled with the use of [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno)'s tweaking tool.
